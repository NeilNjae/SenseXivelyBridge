Sense Configuration Options
===========================

Sense configuration information is stored in the file .sensesettings.ini that resides in the
user's home folder (the location of which is OS-specific).

When Sense wants to read the settings it first looks for that file. If the file is missing it
attempts to load settings from .sensesettings.ini located in the installation folder, and uses
whatever it finds there to create the user's .sensesettings.ini. This means that Sense can
be shipped with default settings that can subsequently be changed on a per user basis.

It follows that there is a subtle difference between there being no user ini file and that file
being empty. If the user file is empty there are no settings; if the user file doesn't exist
then Sense will always attempt to recreate it using the version from the installation folder.

Settings in the configuration file take the form:

key=value

The valid keys are listed below. For each key the valid values are defined. Note that keys are
not case sensitive (but values may be).

baudrate
	If this key is present then its value defines the baud rate to use for the OU/Sense board.
	If this key is absent then the baud rate will be the default defined in Sense. The current
	baud rate can be seen - and changed - using the shift-click menu of the Sensor Board
	Watcher. Note that this setting does not affect the baud rate used for Pico boards.
homedir
	If this key is present then its value defines the path to the parent of the user's Sense
	folders. That is, the folder in which Sense will either expect to find a folder called
	'Sense' or create one. The specified folder must exist - if it doesn't then this entry is
	ignored. If this key is absent then the standard OS-specific user documents folder is used
	(for Vista/Win7 this is \Users\<user-name>\documents).
homedirprefix
	If this key is present then it defines the name of a folder that sits between the user's
	home dir (see above) and the Sense folders. So under Vista/Win7, if homedir is absent and
	homedirprefix is set to 'TU100' then the user's Sense folder will be
	\Users\<user-name>\documents\TU100\Sense.
portscanningenabled
	If the value is true or the key is absent then Sense will automatically scan all
	relevant serial ports to determine whether a sensor board is connected. If the value is
	anything other than true then Sense will not scan the computer's serial ports.
proxenabled
	If this key is present and the value is true then the proxy defined by proxyserver and
	proxyport will be used. Note that this option is normally configured using the
	Extras menu in Sense. Has no effect if proxyserver is not defined.
proxyserver
	If this key is present then the value will be used as the url of the proxy server to
	use for all internet access. Note that this option is normally configured using the
	Extras menu in Sense.
proxyport
	If a proxy server is configured (using the proxyserver option) then the value of this
	option is used as the port number of the proxy server. If a proxy server is configured
	but this option is absent then port 3128 will be used. Note that this option is normally
	configured using the Extras menu in Sense.
rssposturl
	The value is the full url to be used when posting rss items, or loading rss when no server is
	specified. If this option is absent then (for the time being) the url
	http://feedcatcher.njae.me.uk is used.
sensorconfig-n
	If present this option specifies the configuration for the sensor whose index is n. There
	may be several sensorconfig-n lines in the .ini file; each line specifies the configuration
	for a different sensor, as indicated by the value of n. The value of the option comprises
	a number of comma-separated fields:
		<con>,<bool>,<con-name>,<bool-name>
		
		<con> must have the value Y or N. If Y then this sensor can return a range of values.
		If N then this sensor can only return boolean values and the second field must be Y.
		<bool> must have the value Y or N. If Y then this sensor can return a boolean value.
		If N then this sensor cannot be treated as a boolean and the first field must be Y.
		<con-name> is the name for this sensor in the watcher and in blocks that return a
		range of values.
		<bool-name> is the name for this sensor in blocks that return boolean values. Ignored
		if <bool> is N.
		
		Examples:
		
		sensorconfig-4=Y,N,voltage,null
			Configure sensor 4 to return a range of values, cannot be treated as a boolean
		
		sensorconfig-3=Y,Y,level,level reached
			Configure sensor 3 to return a range of values or be treated as a boolean
			
		sensorconfig-6=N,Y,null,switch
			Configure sensor 6 as a boolean input, e.g. a button		
sensorcount
	If absent Sense displays the names all of all the sensors supported by the protocol handler.
	The value of this option must be a number. Values greater than the number of sensors
	supported by the protocol handler are ignored. The number specifies the number of sensors
	that will be displayed in block menus and in the sensor board watcher.
signonurlsubstring
	If a http get or post redirects to a url that contains the value of this option as a
	substring then the redirection will be assumed to be a sign-on request. If this option
	is absent then the string https://msds.open.ac.uk/signon/ is used as the substring.
signonposturl
	The value of this option is the url to which sign-on credentials are posted. If this
	option is absent the url https://msds.open.ac.uk/signon/SAMS001A.aspx is used.
useoldsensorprotocol
	If present and the value is true then Sense will use the prototype Sense board protocol
	(board id = 0). The prototype protocol has been superseded.
visibledrives
	A comma-separated list of the drives that are to be shown in file dialog boxes. If absent
	then all drives are shown.

Note: In the unusual situation that the Scratch plugin cannot be loaded, then the .sensesettings.ini
file located in the Sense program folder will be used as if it is the user's settings file.

Curl Plugin
===========

The Curl Plugin provides access to the curl libraries, which are used for https accesses in Sense.

Windows
-------

The following files must be in the same folder as the VM executable:

CurlPlugin.dll (the plug-in itself)
libcurl-4.dll (the curl library)
libssl32.dll (open ssl library)
libeay32.ddl (encryption functions)
CurlPluginCaCert.pem (Cerfificate Authority certificates)

These files are in curl-plugin-windows.zip.

OSX
---

The plugin lives in a bundle called CurlPlugin.bundle. This folder must be placed in the Resources folder
of the Scratch.app bundle folder. The CurlPluginCaCert.pem file must be in the same folder as the Scratch.app bundle.

These files are in curl-plugin-osx.zip.

linux
----- 

The plugin is a shared library called CurlPlugin. It needs to reside alongside the other Squeak plugins -
in the standard installation that is *not* the Scratch folder but a Squeak folder inside Scratch. The command
line used to start scratch will have an option specifying the plugin folder.

The CurlPluginCaCert.pem file must be in the Scratch folder.

These files are in curl-plugin-linux.zip.

Note that the plugin has dependencies on curl, libssl, etc. To check that you have all the libraries you
need, cd to the folder holding CurlPlugin and do:

ldd CurlPlugin

If any libraries are shown as missing you will need to install them.
