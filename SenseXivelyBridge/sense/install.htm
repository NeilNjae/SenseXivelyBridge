<p>Sense is supported on OSX 10.4 and later. These are draft instructions for installing a Sense installation kit.</p>

<p>The kit is a zip file. Download it into the Applications folder. Then double-click it so that it is expanded.
You should have a folder inside Applications called Sense. Now make the application runnable by opening a Terminal
window and running this command:</p>
<font size="+1"><code>chmod 755 /Applications/Sense/Sense.app/Contents/MacOS/Scratch</code></font>

<p>Now you can run Sense simply by double-clicking on the Sense application in the /Applications/Sense folder.
If you want you can create a shortcut by dragging the Sense application into the Dock.</p>
